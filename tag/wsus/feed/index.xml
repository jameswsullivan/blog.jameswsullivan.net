					<description><![CDATA[Fix clients who are not reporting to WSUS server after installation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently set up a WSUS Server at work to deploy updates to client workstations and ran into some common issues which I assume every IT administrator must have come across, such as clients not reporting, updates report errors, etc.</p>



<p>For me, the client not reporting issue was fairly simple to resolve &#8211; going to each client and manually click &#8220;check for updates&#8221;, and then the client would show up in WSUS console right away. The rest of the clients did show up eventually, it just took them sometime. And for me the <code>wuauclt /detectnow, /reportnow, /updatenow</code> didn&#8217;t work as fast as going to the clients and clicking &#8220;check for updates&#8221;.</p>



<p>Here is a very useful article that helped me along the way, highly recommended.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[WSUS Server's Reset Server Node error.]]></description>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Issue:</h2>



<p>When attempting to bring up the synchronization history, the window would freeze at <code>Loading synchronization history: 0% complete.</code> and eventually prompted <code>Reset Server Node</code>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Solution:</h2>



<p>1. During the initial synchronization, make sure that your server has sufficient memory. I set my VM to 64GB RAM just in case, and eventually found that the RAM usage climbed up all the way to over 13GB to finish. After the initial synchronization is finished, the subsequent synchronizations wouldn&#8217;t use that much RAM anymore, so it&#8217;s safe to tune down the VM&#8217;s RAM.</p>



<p>2. You&#8217;ll also need to set the following values in IIS Manager for the initial synchronization to finish without errors.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Go to IIS Manager - Application Pools - WsusPool - Advanced Settings and modify the following fields:

Queue Length: 25000
Limit Interval (minutes): 15
"Service Unavailable" Response: TcpLevel
Failure Interval (minutes): 30
Maximum Failures: 60
Private Memory Limit (KB): 0</code></pre>



<p>3. I also needed to delete the synchronization history from the SUSDB to be able to sync again, I think it was because my initial sync failed due to insufficient RAM. To delete the sync history from SUSDB, you will need <code>Microsoft SSMS</code> (Run As Administrator) and connect to</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><code>\\.\pipe\MICROSOFT##WID\tsql\query</code>
and run the following commands:

USE SUSDB
GO
DELETE FROM tbEventInstance WHERE EventNamespaceID= '2' AND EVENTID IN ('381','382','384','386','387','389')</code></pre>



<p>4. The <code>Microsoft ReportViewer</code> and <code>Microsoft System CLR Types for SQL Server 2012</code> will need to be installed to view update error logs.</p>
