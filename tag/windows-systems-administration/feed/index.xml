										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-background">Background:</h2>



<p>I came across two more cheap Mac Mini A1347 (one is late-2014 the other is a mid-2011) that I can use for my projects. While restoring them, I came across a few things that&#8217;s worth noting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Issues:</h2>



<ol>
<li>The mid-2011 model has great difficulty with drivers (particularly display and sound) with Windows 10/11.</li>



<li>The mid-2011 model gets very hot when just under normal workload.</li>



<li>The late-2014 model automatically turns on after applying power (which is something I want to disable).</li>



<li>Install 16GB RAM and a second hard drive to the mid-2011 model.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-issues">Solutions:</h2>



<p>1. The mid-2011 model has great difficulty with drivers (particularly display and sound) with Windows 10/11.</p>



<p>The mid-2011 model (<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/sp632?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2.3Ghz variant</a>) has the Intel HD 3000 graphics card and the Cirrus Audio CS4206B sound card, both of which don&#8217;t have official driver support for anything beyond Windows 7. Plus, if Windows is installed using EFI, the screen is going to go black as soon as HD 3000&#8217;s display driver gets applied, and installing the Cirrus Audio driver will not work either. While you can force Windows to use the Basic Display Driver (Microsoft Basic Display Adapter) by uninstalling the display driver using <a href="https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DDU</a> and blocking the Hardware Ids using Group Policy (will explain in the last section of this post), it&#8217;s not an elegant solution after all and you&#8217;ll still suffer from no audio (from both HDMI and Cirrus Audio).</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>According to some research, it seems that there might be a solution by using DSDT modification/override so that the hardware can be properly &#8220;seen&#8221; and handled correctly by the OS under UEFI. But it&#8217;s not worth it for me to go down that rabbit hole to figure it out, so I just opted for Legacy BIOS mode (which also means that Windows 11 is not the best option). </p>
</blockquote>



<p>After installing Windows 10 using Legacy BIOS mode, everything works fine except the Display-Audio via HDMI despite the fact that all drivers have been installed and are showing that they work &#8220;correctly&#8221; in Device Manager. There is nothing indicating errors but HDMI and Thunderbolt ports both output no sound to the TV. But it&#8217;s acceptable in my case to use as a &#8220;media player&#8221; for my treadmill, which accepts a 3.5mm audio input to the treadmill&#8217;s speakers.</p>



<p>Download:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jameswsullivan/blog-file-share/blob/main/Macmini5%2C1-Drivers.7z">Windows 10 drivers for Mac Mini mid-2011 (Macmini5,1)</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-">DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller)</a> (<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000091878/graphics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reference</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090440/graphics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intel HD 4000&#8217;s driver</a> seems to also work for Intel HD 3000, and its Display Audio driver is a newer version which supports &#8220;Windows 10&#8221;, but I still wasn&#8217;t able to get sound from HDMI/Thunderbolt.</p>



<p>2. The mid-2011 model gets very hot when just under normal workload.</p>



<p>I guess this was somewhat &#8220;by design&#8221; because I&#8217;ve done my due diligence to check, clean, and restore everything I can think of &#8211; heatsink, thermal paste, fan, etc.. It&#8217;s been restored to a condition that&#8217;s almost like new. After some Googling around I think it&#8217;s just how this particular model is, because the aluminum case is designed to act as a &#8220;heatsink&#8221; to dissipate heat, I guess I&#8217;m just used to newer model&#8217;s cooler and quieter designs.</p>



<p>3. The late-2014 model automatically turns on after applying power (which is something I want to disable).</p>



<p>One of the late-2014 models automatically turns on after applying power, and judging from what was originally installed on it, it seems to be used as a display device at a medical facility that runs a 24/7 slideshow. Disabling it was easy:</p>



<p>Get into Recovery Mode by <code>Option/Windows Key + R</code> , and open <strong>Terminal</strong> under <strong>Utilities</strong>, and type the following command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># To disable:
pmset autorestart 0

# If you want to enable "Power On After Power-Loss", set the value to 1 instead.
pmset autorestart 1</code></pre>



<p>4. Install 16GB RAM and a second hard drive to the mid-2011 model.</p>



<p>RAM and a second hard drive are one of the most popular upgrades done on this model, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Mac_Mini_Mid_2011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ifixit has very well made instructions</a>.</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Forcing Windows 11 (in UEFI mode) to use Microsoft Basic Display Adapter without automatically installing drivers.</h2>



<p>Find the &#8220;Hardware Ids&#8221;:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Device Manager -- Display adapters -- Properties -- Details tab -- Select "Hardware Ids" from the Property drop-down -- Copy them to a text file.</code></pre>



<p>Block them using Group Policy:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Open Local Group Policy Editor, go to Computer Configuration -- Administrative Templates -- System -- Device Installation -- Device Installation Restrictions -- "Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs."

Enable it and add the Hardware Ids you found from Device Manager.</code></pre>



<p>Additionally, you can configure the following to stop Windows 11 from automatically updating drivers:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Open Local Group Policy Editor, go to Computer Configuration -- Administrative Templates -- Windows Components -- Windows Update -- Manage Updates offered from Windows Update -- Enable “Do not include drivers with Windows Updates”</code></pre>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Open Settings -- System -- About -- Advanced system settings -- Hardware tab -- Device Installation Settings -- Check "No (your device might not work as expected)"</code></pre>



<p>During the process, if the screen goes black after Windows 11 automatically applies a display driver (Intel HD 3000 in this case), you might need to get into Safe Mode to use <a href="https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DDU</a> to remove the driver. You can force powering off the machine three times to get into Advanced boot options (Recovery) mode, or you can try the following trick (because the OS is not frozen or dead, it&#8217;s just the screen that&#8217;s gone black, so you can still do things &#8220;blindly&#8221;):</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Windows + R (Run) -- type "shutdown /r /o /t /f 0"</code></pre>



<p>Assuming there is nothing else blocking the reboot, it should go to the Advanced boot options menu upon restart.</p>



<p>If you need to install anything while in Safe Mode, enable Windows Installer using the following commands in a command prompt:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>REG ADD “HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Network\MSIServer” /VE /T REG_SZ /F /D “Service”

net start msiserver</code></pre>

					<description><![CDATA[Refurbish Mac Mini A1347 (late 2014, EMC 2840, 820-5509-A) - Part 2 - Install Windows 11 natively.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background:</h2>



<p>As detailed in <a href="https://jameswsullivan.github.io/refurbish-mac-mini-a1347-late-2014-part-1/">the previous article</a>, after the Mac Minis were restored (hardware wise), I decided to use one of them as a &#8220;media player&#8221; and mount it on the back of a monitor and place it in front of the treadmill to use while I work out. And since it&#8217;ll only be used as a media player, installing Windows 11 on it won&#8217;t be a bad idea.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t use BootCamp and didn&#8217;t have macOS and Windows dual OS, Windows 11 was installed natively. However, without going through the BootCamp process means that the Windows drivers issue won&#8217;t be automatically resolved.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Solution:</h2>



<p>After installing Windows 11, use <a href="https://github.com/timsutton/brigadier">Brigadier</a> to download and install BootCamp and drivers, after the drivers are successfully installed, BootCamp and other Apple related software can be safely removed.</p>



<p>Currently there is <a href="https://github.com/timsutton/brigadier/issues/37">a 7zip issue</a> (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2414/">7zip bug</a>) when unpacking the payload with brigadier. The easiest way to avoid this issue is to install the <code>7-Zip 22.01 (2022-07-15)</code> version.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fix the Invalid Time error and the Time Zone setting greyed out issue on Windows.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Problems:</h2>



<ul>
<li>For some reason the <code>time.windows.com</code> occasionally has issues with certain programs and produce the Invalid Time error.</li>



<li>Sometimes the <code>Time zone</code> setting is greyed out in Windows Settings (Windows 10).</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Solutions:</h2>



<p>To solve the Invalid Time error, configure the NTP server to use <code>time.nist.gov</code> instead:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Control Panel - Date and Time - Internet Time - Change Settings ... - Synchronize with an Internet time server - Set server to: time.nist.gov</pre>



<p>If your <code>Time zone</code> setting is greyed out in Windows Settings, use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/shell-experience/cannot-set-timezone-automatically">this guide</a> to fix:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>1. Change the Set time zone automatically setting and set the data value of the registry entry

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\tzautoupdate\Start

as follows:

3	Enable Set time zone automatically
4	Disable Set time zone automatically


2. Change the location setting and set the value of the registry entry

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CapabilityAccessManager\ConsentStore\location\Value

as follows:

Allow	On
Deny	Off</code></pre>

					<description><![CDATA[Create Storage Pools and Virtual Disks via PowerShell when New Virtual Disk Wizard GUI emits error.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Issue:</h2>



<p>If creating New Virtual Disk using the New Virtual Disk Wizard GUI emits this error:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Failed to create virtual disk - Not Supported

Extended information:
The storage pool does not have sufficient eligible resources for the creation of the specified virtual disk.

Recommended Actions:
- Choose a combination of FaultDomainAwareness and NumberOfDataCopies (or PhysicalDiskRedundancy) supported by the storage pool.
- Choose a value for NumberOfColumns that is less than or equal to the number of physical disks in the storage fault domain selected for the virtual disk.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Solution:</h2>



<p>Try using PowerShell to create the Storage Pool (<a href="https://www.petenetlive.com/KB/Article/0001562">Reference article</a>). You might encounter this problem if you have multiple SSDs/HDDs connected to the host via an HBA Adapter.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Repair Windows Explorer crash with SFC /SCANNOW and DISM after Windows Update's reboot caused system file damage.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background:</h2>



<p>The initial file corruption seems to have happened after an automated reboot by Windows Update while some disc scanning operations were still ongoing. The sudden reboot probably damaged some system files and resulted in Windows Explorer crashing immediately after opening. Windows Explorer would also crash immediate when your right click on any drives as well as on the recycle bin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Solution:</h2>



<p>The repair process was fairly straightforward using <code>SFC</code> and <code>DISM</code>. However, <code>SFC /SCANNOW</code> was not able to perform the repair at first and gave the <code>Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation.</code> message. This usually points to corrupted files that would require a disk scan. <code>CHKDSK C: /R</code> was issued and system drive was checked and repaired upon next reboot.</p>



<p>After <code>CHKDSK</code> finished and all disk errors were repaired, <code>SFC /SCANNOW</code> was still not successful due to some files&#8217; <code>hash mismatch</code> (logs can be checked under <code>WINDIR\LOGS\CBS\CBS.log</code>), so I resorted to using <code>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</code> . However, after issuing this command, it was still unable to perform the repair with another error message <code>The source files could not be found</code>. This indicates that you&#8217;ll need a healthy Windows installation ISO file to be the source file, usually you can use the <code>Windows Media Creation Tool</code> to create an installation media, but when I performed the repair in <code>Safe Mode</code> , the Media Creation Tool was failing with the error code <strong>0x8007043C &#8211; 0x90018</strong> every time it ran. As a workaround, I used <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php"><strong>this</strong></a> link to manually download a Windows 10 ISO file. When the ISO file is ready, extract the content into a folder and check under the &#8220;sources&#8221; directory to see whether you have the file <code>install.wim</code> or <code>install.esd</code>, as the following commands will be slight different.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># Assume the extracted installation files are under E:\Win10\sources\install.wim .

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:wim:E:\Win10\sources\install.wim:6 /LimitAccess

# Use this command instead if your image contains install.esd file.

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:ESD:E:\Win10\sources\install.ESD:6 /LimitAccess

# This command eventually did the trick for me and successfully finished the repair. If you need to find out the index number of the right Windows version to use (the index number might be different if you're using a different installation image), the following command can help identify, and then just replace the number 6 in the commands above with the right Windows version that fits your needs.

DISM /get-wiminfo /wimfile:E:\Win10\sources\install.wim</code></pre>

					<description><![CDATA[NETLONGON and SYSVOL not shared and "The system cannot find the file specified." error when editing group policy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background:</h2>



<p>After some migration work done on the Domain Controllers, I started to get the following errors on the new DC when editing group policies.</p>



<ul>
<li>NETLONGON and SYSVOL are not shared.</li>



<li>When editing a group policy object (which used to work just fine), the new DC now prompts a &#8220;The system cannot find the file specified.&#8221; error.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Solution:</h2>



<p>I haven&#8217;t come across this issue before but experience tells me that this might be something related to syncing/replication. After some research, I found <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/group-policy/force-authoritative-non-authoritative-synchronization" data-type="URL" data-id="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/group-policy/force-authoritative-non-authoritative-synchronization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this Microsoft documentation</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja53C2Mz1EQ" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja53C2Mz1EQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this YouTube video</a> that resolved my issue. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>1. Open adsiedit.msc, expand all the way to:

OU=Domain Controllers --> CN=NameOfDC --> CN=DFSR-LocalSettings --> CN=Domain System Volume --> CN=SYSVOL Subscription

2. Change <strong>the good one</strong> (here uses DC01 as an example)'s msDFSR-Enabled to False, and msDFSR-Options to 1. (Authoritative)

3. Change <strong>the bad one</strong> (here uses DC02 as an example)'s msDFSR-Enabled to False, only. (You can repeat this step for all the other DCs that are not syncing correctly.) (Non-Authoritative)

4. On DC01, run an elevated powershell window, run
repadmin /syncall /AdeP
stop-service dfsr

5. Now hop on to DC02, run an elevated powershell window and run
stop-service dfsr

6. Now back on DC01, run
start-service dfsr

Now that in Event Viewer under Applications and Services Logs --> DFS Replication, you should find a 4114 event.

7. Go back to ADSI Edit, change DC01's msDFSR-Enabled back to True.

8. On DC01, in powershell, run
repadmin /syncall /AdeP
DFSRDIAG POLLAD

In Event Viewer, a 4602 event should now be seen.

9. Now go to DC02, run
start-service dfsr

10. Go back to ADSI Edit, change DC02's msDFSR-Enabled back to True.

11. Still on DC02, run
DFSRDIAG POLLAD</code></pre>



<p>Depending on your environment, you might need to give it a bit time for the replication to finish, though for me the fix was instant.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fix clients who are not reporting to WSUS server after installation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently set up a WSUS Server at work to deploy updates to client workstations and ran into some common issues which I assume every IT administrator must have come across, such as clients not reporting, updates report errors, etc.</p>



<p>For me, the client not reporting issue was fairly simple to resolve &#8211; going to each client and manually click &#8220;check for updates&#8221;, and then the client would show up in WSUS console right away. The rest of the clients did show up eventually, it just took them sometime. And for me the <code>wuauclt /detectnow, /reportnow, /updatenow</code> didn&#8217;t work as fast as going to the clients and clicking &#8220;check for updates&#8221;.</p>



<p>Here is a very useful article that helped me along the way, highly recommended.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[WSUS Server's Reset Server Node error.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Issue:</h2>



<p>When attempting to bring up the synchronization history, the window would freeze at <code>Loading synchronization history: 0% complete.</code> and eventually prompted <code>Reset Server Node</code>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Solution:</h2>



<p>1. During the initial synchronization, make sure that your server has sufficient memory. I set my VM to 64GB RAM just in case, and eventually found that the RAM usage climbed up all the way to over 13GB to finish. After the initial synchronization is finished, the subsequent synchronizations wouldn&#8217;t use that much RAM anymore, so it&#8217;s safe to tune down the VM&#8217;s RAM.</p>



<p>2. You&#8217;ll also need to set the following values in IIS Manager for the initial synchronization to finish without errors.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Go to IIS Manager - Application Pools - WsusPool - Advanced Settings and modify the following fields:

Queue Length: 25000
Limit Interval (minutes): 15
"Service Unavailable" Response: TcpLevel
Failure Interval (minutes): 30
Maximum Failures: 60
Private Memory Limit (KB): 0</code></pre>



<p>3. I also needed to delete the synchronization history from the SUSDB to be able to sync again, I think it was because my initial sync failed due to insufficient RAM. To delete the sync history from SUSDB, you will need <code>Microsoft SSMS</code> (Run As Administrator) and connect to</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><code>\\.\pipe\MICROSOFT##WID\tsql\query</code>
and run the following commands:

USE SUSDB
GO
DELETE FROM tbEventInstance WHERE EventNamespaceID= '2' AND EVENTID IN ('381','382','384','386','387','389')</code></pre>



<p>4. The <code>Microsoft ReportViewer</code> and <code>Microsoft System CLR Types for SQL Server 2012</code> will need to be installed to view update error logs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Issue:</h2>



<p>Recently a Skype for Business user was unable to see what others were presenting during a Skype meeting. The user&#8217;s &#8220;Stage&#8221; area showed blank white screen when other participants &#8220;Present Programs …&#8221;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Solution:</h2>



<p>The fix is easy &#8211; deleting a registry folder that&#8217;s related to ActiveX control.</p>



<ol>
<li>Open regedit and navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility</li>



<li>Delete the folder: {00000000-0000-0000-000000000000}</li>



<li>Restart Skype for Business.</li>
</ol>
